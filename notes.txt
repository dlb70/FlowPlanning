Need to:
1. Formulate mathematical model .
2. Write code to generate .lp file .
3. Use CPLEX to solve optimization problems and generate solutions .
4. Write a report describing problem and solutions .

Assignment is based on sections 7.4 (7.4.1,7.4.2), and 5.2.6 .
With;
 - X, Si: source nodes .
 - Y, Tk: transit nodes .
 - Z, Dj: destination nodes .
 - Link capacities Cik, Dkj, as the link capacities between specific nodes .
     (Cik, as link of source<->transit)
     (Dkj, as link of transit<->destination)
 - Demand volumes Hij, as the demand volume between Si<->Dj .
     Values are Hij = i + j
     Demand volumes are split over 3 different paths (read, transit nodes) .
 - Flow volumes Xikj as the share of a demand volume over path Si<->Tk<->Dj .
     For each H, have a set of variables k1..kY of which exactly 3 
      are positive, and all others are zero.
     Xikj are our decision variables.


1.  Code to generate .lp file
 - Objective is load balancing.
 - Optimization is done for generic X,Y,Z E(Z+), Y >= 3 .

2.  CPLEX solving
 - Code generates a matrix of demand volumes .
 - Code generates all possible links .
 - Code generates CPLEX constraints for volume splitting, and capacities .
 - Code generates optimization function and decision variables .
